            <p>
                Classic carbonara is made with spaghetti, eggs, Parmesan cheese, pancetta, and pepper. Cook the pasta, and in a separate pan, cook the pancetta until crisp. Combine the pasta with the pancetta, then mix in a mixture of eggs and cheese, allowing the heat of the pasta to cook the eggs. Serve immediately with extra grated Parmesan.
